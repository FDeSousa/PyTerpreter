PyTerpreter
===========

A Python-based multiple language interpreter. It's a bit crap.

Current State
-------------

Unusable.
The system hasn't been properly tested, or even actually received implementation.

Supported Languages
-------------------

So far, there's only one language supported, and it's not at all feature-complete:

Brainfuck in the PyFuck module
